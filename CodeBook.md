Getting and Cleaning Data – Peer Assessent Project
The main objectives of this work are collecting a data set, work with it and clean it in order to have a tidy data set ready for further analysis.
This work is divided in six steps as below:

Part 1 - Downloading the data
Source of data:  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
# 1.1 - Verifying if directory "Data" exists
# 1.2 - Downloading the file. Note that the file is zipped.
# 1.3 - Unzipping the Dataset file

Part 2 - Reading the files
The files are divided in 2 groups: training tables and testing tables
# The features from the variables are presented in this file, like mean, standard deviation, max and min values.
# Activities types are presented in this file, like walking, walking upstairs and downstairs, sitting, standing and laying.
# 2.1 - Training tables
# 2.2 - Testing tables
# 2.3 - Feature file
# 2.4 - Activity labels

Part 3 - Assigning column names
# The column names for the independent variable "x" come from features file.
# The column names for the dependent variable "y" come from activity file.
# 3.1 - Training files
# 3.2 - Testing files

Part 4 - Merging the data in one data set
# The training and testing groups of files are merged in a unique file, containing all the available information.
# mergedFile has 10299 rows and 563 columns.

Part 5 - Extracting the values of mean and standard deviation for the measurements
# This new vector has 10299 rows and 82 columns. The original file have 563 columns.
# 5.1 - The means and standard deviations are stored in a new vector

Part 6 - Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
# The number of rows were reduced from 10299 rows to 9000 rows due to maximum memory capacity available for the .txt file.
# This tidy data set have 48 columns.
# 6.1 - Creating a second tidy data set
# 6.2 - Writing the 2nd. tidy file in .txt format.
